    Hey! I'm Linus, a 14-year-old vibe coder who loves experimenting with modern web technologies and figuring things out as I go.
  </p>
  <p>
    I don't really know how to code in the traditional sense, but I love tinkering with React, Svelte, Astro, Nuxt, Flask, Django, and cool tools like Supabase and Convex. 
    I'm all about the vibe - using AI tools like Cursor and Claude to help me learn and build stuff that feels right.
  </p>
  <p>
    I'm currently exploring self-hosted infrastructure with Proxmox, TrueNAS, Tailscale, and Cloudflare. 
    It's like having my own little tech playground where I can break things and learn how they work.
  </p>
  <p>
    When I'm not vibe coding, I'm probably discovering new technologies, making random projects, and always learning something new through experimentation.
    Hit me up if you want to vibe code together or just chat about cool tech stuff!
  </p>
