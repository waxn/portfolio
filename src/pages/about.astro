  <p>
    Hey! I'm Linus, a 14-year-old developer who loves building modern web applications and learning about infrastructure.
  </p>
  <p>
    I work across the stack with React, Svelte, Astro, Nuxt, Flask, Django, and modern tools like Supabase and Convex. 
    I'm passionate about clean code, modern development practices, and using AI tools like Cursor and Claude to accelerate learning.
  </p>
  <p>
    I'm currently learning about self-hosted infrastructure with Proxmox, TrueNAS, Tailscale, and Cloudflare. 
    I enjoy building full-stack applications and experimenting with different frameworks and technologies.
  </p>
  <p>
    When I'm not coding, I'm exploring new technologies, contributing to open source projects, and always learning something new.
    Feel free to reach out if you want to collaborate or just chat about development!
  </p>
