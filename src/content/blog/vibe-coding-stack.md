I've recently been exploring what I like to call "vibe coding"â€”a development workflow focused on staying in the creative flow and rapidly bringing ideas to life. This has led me to adopt a new set of tools that prioritize speed, intelligence, and a seamless developer experience.

## The Core Setup: Editor, AI, and Terminal

My setup starts with a powerful editor. I switch between **VSCode** for its robust ecosystem and **Cursor**, an AI-first editor that has been a game-changer.

The real magic happens when I pair my editor with **Windsurf**, an AI coding assistant. It helps me brainstorm, write boilerplate code, and debug issues without breaking my concentration. It's like having a world-class pair programmer available 24/7.

To round out my core environment, I've started using **Amp**, a modern, Rust-based terminal that is incredibly fast and intuitive.

## Frontend and Backend Flexibility

For the frontend, I've been diving into newer web frameworks that allow for quick iteration. On the backend, I'm enjoying a hybrid approach. For projects that require complex, custom logic, I still rely on the power and maturity of **Django** and **Flask**.

However, for rapid prototyping and projects that need a backend up and running in minutes, I've been using Backend as a Service (BaaS) platforms like **Supabase** and **Convex**. They handle the database, authentication, and APIs, letting me focus purely on the frontend experience.

This new stack has transformed how I approach new projects, making the process more enjoyable and productive.
